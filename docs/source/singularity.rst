Introduction to Singularity
===========================
`Singularity <https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/>`_ is a container platform. It allows you to create and run containers that package up pieces of software in a way that is portable and reproducible. 

Singularity is an open-source project designed to run on HPC clusters

What are containers
--------------------
Containers provide virtualized environment: an isolated file system accessible from a host computer

Two important concepts
-----------------------
* Image: a set of layers, read-only templates.
* Container: an instance of an image

You can have many running containers of the same image.
